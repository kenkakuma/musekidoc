# Artist-Pottery Relationships Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the establishment of bidirectional relationships between 60 artists and 21 pottery entries in the Museki database.

## Methodology

### Matching Criteria
Relationships were established based on three primary criteria:

1. **Geographic Connection**
   - Artists working in traditional pottery regions
   - Born or trained in specific pottery centers
   - Current workshop location in historical pottery areas

2. **Technical Specialization**
   - Artists known for specific techniques (e.g., Shino, Oribe, Karatsu)
   - Use of characteristic materials (e.g., Shigaraki clay, Mashiko soil)
   - Traditional training lineages

3. **Historical Lineage**
   - Direct training under masters of specific traditions
   - Family connections to pottery lineages
   - Participation in regional pottery communities

### Conservative Approach
- Only added relationships with clear evidence from artist biographies
- Avoided speculative connections
- Prioritized quality over quantity of relationships
